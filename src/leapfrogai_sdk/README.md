# LeapfrogAI SDK

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The SDK is not a functionally independent component! Please see the root README for more context.

This document is only applicable for integrating the SDK into an API and model backend in a local Python development environment.

## Local Development Setup

1. Make changes to the SDK code
2. Re-install dependencies and spin-up a model backend (e.g., [vLLM](../../packages/vllm/README.md))
3. Re-install dependencies and spin-up the [LeapfrogAI API](../leapfrogai_api/README.md)
4. Test changes as required

## Integration Tests

See the [API documentation](../leapfrogai_api/README.md) for instructions on running tests.
