# This is here to act as a shim for branch protection rules to work correctly.
# This is ugly but this seems to be the best way to do this since:
#  - Job names in a workflow must be unique
#  - When paths are ignored not all jobs are reported to the branch protection rules
#  - Multiple jobs of the same name are still required by branch protection rules

# Abort prior jobs in the same workflow / PR
