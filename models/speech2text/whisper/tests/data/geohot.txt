For a long time, TinyGrad had a hard limit at a thousand lines of code. And what this would force you to do is really make sure you were not wasting lines. I got rid of the restriction because it became a little code-golfy at the end, but once the core framework of TinyGrad was there, in those thousand lines, it\'s not huge now, it\'s like 2,800 lines now, it\'s still very readable, but the core framework, the ideas are expressed with no boilerplate. If you go read PyTorch, you know, PyTorch is actually pretty good code, I think Facebook\'s pretty good, but there\'s so much boilerplate. Go in PyTorch and try to track down how an LU actually works. Just a lot of instructions. Oh, you\'re going to be diving down a long stack from Python to C to custom libraries to dispatchers, and then I don\'t even know how to read TensorFlow. I don\'t even know where\'s an LU in TensorFlow. Nobody knows. Someone at Google knows, maybe. Google as an organism knows. I don\'t know if anyone individual at Google knows.
