# LeapfrogAI End-To-End Tests

This directory holds our e2e tests that we use to verify LFAI-API + various model backend functionality in an environment that replicates a live setting. The tests in this directory are automatically run against a [UDS Core](https://github.com/defenseunicorns/uds-core) cluster whenever a PR is opened or updated.

## Running Tests Locally

The tests in this directory are also able to be run locally! We are currently opinionated towards running on a cluster that is configured with UDS, as we mature out tests & documentations we'll potentially lose some of that opinionation.

### Dependencies

1. Python >= 3.11.6
2. k3d >= v5.6.0
3. uds >= v0.7.0

### Actually Running The Test

There are several ways you can setup and run these tests. Here is one such way:

> Deploy the [UDS cluster](/README.md#uds) \
> NOTE: This stands up a k3d cluster and installs istio & pepr

```bash
# Build and Deploy the LFAI API
make build-api
uds zarf package deploy zarf-package-leapfrogai-api-*.tar.zst

# Build and Deploy the model backend you want to test.
# NOTE: In this case we are showing llama-cpp-python
make build-llama-cpp-python
uds zarf package deploy zarf-package-llama-cpp-python-*.tar.zst

# Install the python dependencies
python -m pip install "."

# Run the tests!
# NOTE: Each model backend has its own e2e test files
python -m pytest tests/e2e/test_llama.py -v

# Cleanup after yourself
k3d cluster delete
```
