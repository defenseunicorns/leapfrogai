      " 8 GEN.9 Suppose an algorithm implementation has been validated. What happens when a change is made inside the implementation’s boundary? It is claimed that no cryptographic functions were changed. Is the algorithm validation still valid?  No. Any change inside the defined boundary of the implementation creates a new implementation, which must be validated. It does not matter what the change is.  For a software algorithm, CAVP validates the binary executable or dynamic library that contains the executable code of the algorithm implementation. The implementation's boundary is effectively the entire binary file that contains the algorithm implementation. So, if that binary file is different, the algorithms in it must be tested again. It does not matter what the change is. Even if the algorithm source code has not changed, the algorithm implementation needs to be retested. GEN.10 If a vendor claims that their implementation runs on multiple operating systems, how should this be validated?  CAVP validations list the operating system and processor, known as the operating environment (OE), on which the testing was conducted. Only the OEs that are tested appear on the validation certificate and can be referenced in module validation. One set of tests is required for each OE to appear on the validation certificate. The OE(s) used for CMVP module validation must match the OE(s) used for algorithm validation.   A vendor is allowed to test on more OEs than required if it so chooses.   GEN.11 A vendor has indicated that the version number of a previously validated algorithm implementation has changed. They indicate that  nothing within the algorithm implementation boundary has been changed. What should be done?  The laboratory would need to verify that none of the code within the algorithm boundary has been modified. The appropriate request to NIST ACVTS would be made by the laboratory requesting an update to the implementation name.\n",
