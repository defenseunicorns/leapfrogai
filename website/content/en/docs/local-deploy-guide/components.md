## Components

### LeapfrogAI API

LeapfrogAI offers an API closely aligned with OpenAI's, facilitating seamless compatibility for tools developed with OpenAI/ChatGPT to operate seamlessly with a LeapfrogAI backend. The LeapfrogAI API is a Python API that exposes LLM backends, via FastAPI and gRPC, in the OpenAI API specification.

### Backend

LeapfrogAI offers several backends for a variety of use cases:

| Backend | AMD64 Support | ARM64 Support | Cuda Support | Docker Ready | K8s Ready | Zarf Ready |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [llama-cpp-python](https://github.com/defenseunicorns/leapfrogai/tree/main/packages/llama-cpp-python) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| [whisper](https://github.com/defenseunicorns/leapfrogai/tree/main/packages/whisper) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| [text-embeddings](https://github.com/defenseunicorns/leapfrogai/tree/main/packages/text-embeddings) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| [vllm](https://github.com/defenseunicorns/leapfrogai/tree/main/packages/vllm) | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |

### Flavors

Each component has different images and values that refer to a specific image registry and/or hardening source. These images are packaged using [Zarf Flavors](https://docs.zarf.dev/ref/examples/package-flavors/):

1. `upstream`: uses upstream vendor images from open source container registries and repositories
2. 🚧 `registry1`: uses [IronBank hardened images](https://repo1.dso.mil/dsop) from the Repo1 harbor registry

Below is the current component flavors list:

| Component                                      |  `upstream`  |  `registry1`  |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ------------ | ------------- |
| [api](packages/api/)                           |      ✅      |      ✅      |
| [ui](packages/ui/)                             |      ✅      |      🚧      |
| [supabase](packages/supabase/)                 |      ✅      |      🚧      |
| [migrations](./Dockerfile.migrations)          |      ✅      |      🚧      |
| [llama-cpp-python](packages/llama-cpp-python/) |      ✅      |      🚧      |
| [whisper](packages/whisper/)                   |      ✅      |      🚧      |
| [text-embeddings](packages/text-embeddings/)   |      ✅      |      🚧      |
| [vllm](packages/vllm/)                         |      ✅      |      🚧      |
| [vllm](packages/vllm/)                         |      ✅      |      🚧      |

Flavors with any components labelled as 🚧 are not available as a quick start bundle deployment yet. Please refer to the [DEVELOPMENT.md](https://github.com/defenseunicorns/leapfrogai/blob/main/docs/DEVELOPMENT.md) for instructions on how to build a component's Zarf package for local testing.

### Artifact Support

LeapfrogAI contains built-in embeddings for RAG and transcription / translation solutions that can handle many different file types. Many of these capabilities are accessible via the LeapfrogAI API. The supported artifact types are as follows:

#### Transcription / Translation

- All formats supported by `ffmpeg` as listed using `ffmpeg -formats`, e.g., `.mp3`, `.wav`, `.mp4`, etc.

#### Embeddings for RAG

- `.pdf`
- `.txt`
- `.html`
- `.htm`
- `.csv`
- `.md`
- `.doc`
- `.docx`
- `.xlsx`
- `.xls`
- `.pptx`
- `.ppt`

### Software Development Kit

The LeapfrogAI SDK offers a standardized collection of Protobuf and Python utilities designed to facilitate the implementation of backends and gRPC. Please see the [LeapfrogAI SDK](https://github.com/defenseunicorns/leapfrogai/tree/main/src/leapfrogai_sdk) sub-directory for the source code and details.

### User Interface

LeapfrogAI offers user-friendly interfaces tailored for common use-cases, including chat, summarization, and transcription, providing accessible options for users to initiate these tasks. Please see the [LeapfrogAI UI](https://github.com/defenseunicorns/leapfrogai/tree/main/src/leapfrogai_ui) GitHub repository for additional information.
